# bcx-aurelia-dnd

First, If you want to play with the source code of included examples.

```
git clone git@github.com:buttonwoodcx/bcx-aurelia-dnd.git
cd bcx-aurelia-dnd
git checkout origin/gh-pages # it's our GitHub pages. Of course, an Aurelia app.
npm install --global aurelia-cli # if you have not installed aurelia-cli
npm install # or yarn install
au run --watch
```

## How bcx-aurelia-dnd was created

When [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) released v1.0.0 in July 2016, we quickly decided to convert our [Buttonwood Cloud Broker](http://www.buttonwood.com.au/products/cloud-broker/cloud-broker/) front-end from React to Aurelia. The whole conversion only took us (one front-end developer, actually) less than three weeks, which tells you how easy Aurelia is.

One obstacle of the re-write is missing drag-and-drop library for our blueprint composer. Previously we were using [React DnD](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/), but there is no equivalent in Aurelia. There are plenty DOM based DnD libraries in JavaScript world, [dragula](https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) is the best in our eyes. We copied dragula code, removed all its DOM mutation code (we don't need that in Aurelia), wrote interface for it to talk with controller layer of MVC, made a working DnD library in one day. `bcx-aurelia-dnd` source code is largely unchanged since that first implementation.

Thanks for Aurelia, `bcx-aurelia-dnd` implementation is very simple. The source code is less than 600 lines of JavaScript, even most of it were copied from dragula to handle events and styling. As always, similar to most libraries, the [source code](https://github.com/buttonwoodcx/bcx-aurelia-dnd) is way shorter than documentation. Pick one to read on :-)

## Why based on dragula, not native HTML5 DnD API

[dragula](https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) implements DnD in plain mouse/touch events, not in native HTML5 DnD API. [Here](https://www.danyow.net/drag-and-drop-with-aurelia/) is the place where we were introduced to dragula, it has some links for issues around native HTML5 DnD API. It resonated with our experience on React DnD which uses native HTML5 DnD API. We had issues on nested source/target and some annoying browser behavior (cursor in IE) in native HTML5 DnD API. None of that affected our dragula based DnD.

Another bonus of dragula, it supports iPad! All examples here works on iPad.

## Use inside Aurelia app

To start with your Aurelia app.

> with aurelia-cli, just do `au install bcx-aurelia-dnd`.

> with jspm, do `jspm install npm:bcx-aurelia-dnd`.

> with webpack, do `npm install --save bcx-aurelia-dnd`.

There is a single class `DndService` provided by `bcx-aurelia-dnd`. Inject it to your component.

```javascript
import {inject} from 'aurelia-framework';
import {DndService} from 'bcx-aurelia-dnd';

@inject(DndService)
export class YourComponent {
  constructor(dndService) {
    this.dndService = dndService;
  }
}
```

> Here we rely on default behavior of Aurelia DI (dependency injection). Aurelia DI creates a singleton `dndService` instance for all components to share.

> For TypeScript user, have a look at [TypeScript Support](#/typescript-support).

That's all you need to bring `DndService` to an Aurelia component. There is no step to set it up as plugin. Now let's get started to add [source and target](#/source-and-target).
